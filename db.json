        "QUESTION – Chinwe (USA): Pastor, I thank God for your life. Your teachings have impacted my life and that of my family positively, and I thank you very much. My question is about the blood of Jesus. Is it right to pray with it? For example, covering your house, children and so on with the blood of Jesus.",
        "ANSWER : Well, this is one of those many things that a lot of Christians have wrongly applied to their lives because of ignorance. They go shouting the blood of Jesus, and they say “I sprinkle the blood of Jesus.” You don’t have the authority to sprinkle the blood of Jesus. In fact, where did you get the blood from? You have no access to that blood. Jesus Christ presented His blood to God in Heaven, in the most Holy Place in Heaven, at the Mercy Seat in Heaven. You have no access to it. Only the High Priest could sprinkle the blood, only the High Priest. You’ve got to understand that. And before the office of that High Priest was established, Moses was the one who sprinkled everything with the blood of calves back in the Old Testament. This is very important. Who has the right to sprinkle the blood? It’s not the Christians sprinkling the blood on himself or on anyone else. It’s just the talk; they have no access to the blood. Let me show you something from the Bible very quickly. The Bible calls it the blood of sprinkling. Okay.",
        null,
        "So, I’ll like to go straight to Hebrew chapter 9 from verse 19, “For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. [Praise God!] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:” [Hebrews 9:19-24] That’s wonderful. It says Moses functioned in the type and Moses sprinkled all things with blood; it was Moses who did that. He didn’t say all the Hebrews sprinkled themselves with blood. They were God’s covenant people, but they weren’t going around sprinkling themselves with blood. That was a responsibility for Moses; afterwards, the High Priest did it. Now when I say the High Priest, it is important for us…it’s just the ministry of the blood at the Mercy Seat, but no longer really having to sprinkle the law because that was the beginning of the testament, so Moses had to do it. But, I want you to follow this [Hebrews] because it did say that Jesus Christ didn’t enter into the figure but into Heaven itself to appear before God for us.",
        null,
        "In Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 24 it says, “And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant [Moses was the mediator of the old covenant; Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant], and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. [Hebrews 12:24]” Let me read to you from Hebrews chapter 8 verse 6, “But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant [talking about Jesus], which was established upon better promises. [Hebrews 8:6]” Jesus Christ is the mediator of this better covenant. So it’s Jesus. Let’s go to chapter 9, Hebrews chapter 9. Now you can catch the whole picture. From verse 14, let me take it from verse 13, “For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. [Hebrews 9:13-15]” He is the mediator of the New Testament by means of death. So he sprinkled his own blood on the New Testament. He sprinkled it on the Mercy Seat. He purged us with his own blood, and he has already done it. He doesn’t have to do it again. Moses had to do that once and ratify the Old Covenant. Jesus had to do His once and ratify the New Testament; He’s already done it. So we are already purged; we are already cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. So, He, the High Priest [Jesus Christ, the mediator of the New Testament] was the only one who had the right to sprinkle the blood, and it was His own blood. He’s already done it [and] no one else can do it; the blood is sprinkled on the Mercy Seat in heaven. You can’t have access to it, and it was not the responsibility of everybody. So you can’t sprinkle the blood.",
        "So that’s it and it’s very important that you realize it. So those who say it are just talking. It’s like saying “twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.” It doesn’t mean anything when you say I sprinkle the blood of Jesus Christ. You don’t have it and you can’t sprinkle it. So it makes no sense to say it.",

Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord. Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? Saith the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste, and ye run everyman unto his own house. Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit”.",
        null,
        "You read this, you will just understand a situation in those days with the children of Israel. He said you are earning and putting it into a bag with holes, this happen to many people. You can see the blessing of God, God is actually showing them that he is for them. So, they get blessed but they keep losing. And like this gentle man said or a lady here, “I get blessed by God and then I lose just as much”. What is wrong? I said the first part of it is from the perspective of self-examination. What are you not doing right? Now for this people who were earning and putting into a bag with holes, getting blessed and losing the blessings. God said; the reason is my house that is lying waste. He said they are concerned about your own thing, what about the things of the house of God. So, the first thing you do is take the things of God seriously become a partner with God in his number one job of reaching others. Don’t just be concerned about you and your family, you got to become concerned about the things of God. That is very very important, so, support the work of the Lord. Now, if you study further on this particular chapter Haggai 1 where we were reading, if you keep reading on to the end of it, you will find that the prophet got the people to reconcile their behavior with God and change their attitude and they decided that they were going to build the house of God. And so, the blessings will flow continually rather than earning and putting it a bag with holes. But, the second part of it is this, let’s assume this was alright. Let’s assume you were doing it right, there is another part.",
        null,
        "I want to read from Malachi 3:8-11 “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts”. Now look at that, he said bring in all the tithes and offerings to the house of God. And then he says I will pour you out a blessing, so now, if we assume that you are handling this part properly. You are giving into the work of the Lord, you are concerned about the things of God. And then, you are participating like this as you should and yet the devourer is there. Now, there is something you got to do, you know at the time of this writing in the book of Malachi. The Bible lets us understand that Jesus hadn’t come, satan had not been defeated and God had to rebuke the devourer himself. The devourer is satan and he is behind all the waste. He’s called the waster, he is behind all the waste and all the destruction and all the loses that we experience. He is behind them, he is remotely behind this things and he hasn’t been defeated yet and God had to be the one to rebuke that devourer.",
        "Today, when you fulfil your part, you have the authority to rebuke that devourer. So, if you are participating in the things of God and you are supporting the work of the Lord, giving into the work of the Lord, giving as you should in your tithes and in your offerings. Then, you can stand against the devourer yourself, don’t wait for God to say something to the devourer. You are the one to do that, you are the one today but it will not work as long as you are a lawful captive. And Make those words “A Lawful Captive”. Now, I will just read you a little portion from the New Testament in 2 Corinthians 10:3-6 “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled”. You see that is the principle, that is the principle, it shows that God can take action or the word of God will work on your behalf when your own obedience is fulfilled. You cannot rebuke the devourer when you are in disobedience. You see that, you got to function according to God’s word, if you are going to function in authority as well. So, if the devourer is going to be listening to you, you better be listening to God yourself. So, that’s what it’s all about!",

        "There’re those who believe you can only speak in tongues when you’ve attained a certain “spiritual high” or ecstasy. They believe if you pray for a long time in your known dialect – in your understanding – you’d eventually get to that spiritual moment of ecstasy, where the Holy Spirit makes you lose your mind and then you start speaking in tongues. But that’s not the way it works.",

I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.”",
        "Observe the Apostle Paul’s words; he said, “For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful…” In other words, I don’t understand what I’m saying because the words aren’t coming from my mind, but directly form my spirit. So what do I do? “…I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.”",

        "Paul is telling us here that we can decide to pray either with our spirits or with our understanding. Thus, we don’t have to wait for any “spiritual high” or for the Spirit to take over our lips before we start praying in the spirit. The Spirit’s part is to give us utterance or the ability to speak in other tongues (Acts 2:4), which He has already done. Without that ability, we would be trying to form and force those words out of our mouths, which will fail.",
        "The Bible says in Acts 2:4 that the Apostles were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. They didn’t create words; they spoke as the Holy Ghost gave them utterance. All they needed to do was open their mouths and speak. So you can speak in tongues anytime; even now! You don’t have to try and force the utterance. The Holy Spirit is you inspires those heavenly words in your spirit, which you’re to speak forth in other tongues. So it’s up to you to open your mouth in faith and speak in tongues whenever you choose!",

        "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).",
        "Grace is the outward reflection of the glory of God in your spirit. It’s the favour of God manifested in your life. Ephesians 4:7 tells us that “… unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ”; so you’re full of grace. John 1:16 says, “And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.” You’ve received of the Lord’s fullness to be the expression of His grace.",
        "Grace is the supernatural influence at work in you that causes everything you do to prosper; it’s a divine enablement that causes increase, promotion, and progress! However, the degree to which you let the grace of God in you reflect on the outside is up to you. The more you fill your heart with God’s Word and have the Holy Spirit work in your life, the greater grace will shine forth on the outside.",
        null,
        "You can and should increase in that outward reflection of the glory of God in your spirit, to such an extent that others would see it and testify to it. They might not be able to explain it, but they’ll glorify God for His beauty and excellence that’s manifested in your life. In 2 Peter 3:18, the Spirit of God, through the Apostle Peter admonished us to grow in grace: “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ….”",
        "The word “grow” is the Greek “auxano” and it means to “increase” or “enlarge.” In other words, God wants you to increase in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. For example, when the Lord Jesus was a child, the Bible says He “… grew (increased), and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him” (Luke 2:40). He increased in grace, even as a child, and He had favour with God and man (Luke 2:52). The grace of God will attract the right people, materials, and resources you need to function in God’s destiny for your life. Celebrate that grace in your life today.",

        "When Jesus died on the Cross, He knew that if we got to hear about His love, we’d believe and become one with Him. He had faith in what He did, in His vicarious sacrifice for us. He trusted that we’d become everything He died, was buried, and rose back to life for. That’s the faith of the Son of God by which we’re to live.",
        "Think about it this way: imagine that you have a son who’s about to sit for his final exam. The exam costs quite some money, but you’re ready to stake everything. You say to him, “Son, all the money we have at the moment is what we’re paying for you to sit for this exam, but that’s nothing, because we trust you’d be successful, and as a result, things will change for the family.”",
        "Now, your son understands that the hope of the entire family is on him; he knows he’s got to be successful at this exam; he can’t afford to disappoint the family. So, he’ll act on your faith in him—which will become his driving force. His friends may be partying, but he’ll act differently, because he knows you’ve invested everything in him, and wants to justify the confidence reposed in him.",
        "That’s akin to Galatians 2:20: the life we now live, we live by the faith of the Son of God who loved us and gave up everything for us. We can’t fail or disappoint Him. This is the reason you must live your life differently, setting your affection on Him, on things above, and not on things on earth or the flesh. Be determined that you’d walk in, and manifest, the full blessings of the Gospel which are yours in Christ. Live to His dream; His expectation; live by the faith of the Son of God!",

Matthew 5:15 says, “Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.”",
        "This lets you know your calling as a Christian. You’re called to light up the darkness. Psalm 74:20 says, “…the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty,” but you’re that light in a dark world.",
        "Ephesians 5:13 tells us, “…all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light: for whatever doth make manifest is light.” Light is that which makes manifest; light illuminates. You have a calling in this life to bring illumination to your world. 1 Thessalonians 5:5 says, “Ye are all children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.” You can’t be different from your origin; the offspring of a dog will naturally be a dog, not a cat. Therefore, as a child of light, you’re light! You unveil God’s Word and reveal the things of the Spirit to the world.",
        "You’re the light of your world, in much the same way as Jesus was the Light of the world. The Lord Jesus announced to the people: “I am the light of the world. If anyone follows me, he shall not walk in darkness but he shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). That’s just how you are! As a student, you’re the light in your school. As a businessperson, you’re the light of your industry. As a police officer, you’re the light of the service and community. As a soldier, you’re the light of the army. You’re the light in your workplace. Go ahead and light up your world! Let the love of Christ so shine through you, that the world may see it and glorify God in you.",

There’s nothing that I do that is void of the anointing. The anointing of God is on everything that I do. This anointing causes me to expand, spread, flourish and advance in life. This is my year of the supernatural and I am far ahead of any competitor or distractor. Hallelujah! The speed of the Spirit has been granted me and I experience luxuriant growth and persistent productivity in every area of my life. Whatever I set my heart to do, the blessing of God is on it. I have multiplied abilities, wherever I am being checked or tested; the least they will ever find is that I am ten times better. I am anointed to walk on water and everywhere around me is green. Blessed be God. Hallelujah!",

        "Sometimes, you just know in your spirit that something needs to change in your life, and if you don’t take advantage of that intuition, you could lose the moment. When you know inside you that the time has come for a change or for something to happen, don’t take it lightly; start praying about it, and if, after sometime, you still haven’t seen the desired results, you add fasting to it. If the change still doesn’t occur after a while, keep praying and fasting about it, because the delay could be by Satan.",
        "This was what happened to Daniel as he prayed for the deliverance of God’s people. He had read in the Book of Jeremiah that the deliverance of Israel would come after seventy years in exile, so he knew the time had come and thus began to pray. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia detained the angel that was to bring Daniel the message. Daniel, nonetheless, was faithful and kept praying.",
        "After twenty-one days, the angel of the Lord finally came with the answer and explained what had happened (Read Daniel 10:13-14). The angel that God sent to Daniel was delayed in the spirit realm, until Michael, one of the chief angels, came to help him.",
        "Perhaps you perceive that it’s time for a transformation in your family, business, academics, finances, health, or ministry. Take it up; fast, and pray! On the other hand, maybe you sense that there’s a certain level of operation of God’s Spirit that should be at work in your life, but you’re not experiencing it; give it attention. Fast and pray about it, because if you don’t, you may lose the timing, as well as the opportunity. So, like Daniel, set your face “…to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting…” (Daniel 9:3-4 AMP).",

In all my endeavours, I have mighty harvests of blessings and miracles; for the Lord has made all grace available to me, to have all sufficiency in all things. The work of my hands are blessed and my substance has increased. I’ve been separated from the destruction that ruins men’s lives and the judgment that works in the lives of men. The Lord has set me on the path of honour and kingdom dignity. Daily, I am conscious of the ever-increasing glory and honour in my life. I’ve been granted authority to thread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the ability of the devil! At the Name of Jesus, every knee bows, and every tongue confesses that Jesus is Lord! I reign over the devil, the flesh, and the world, with my faith-filled affirmations. Hallelujah! My life is free of struggles because the Lord is my satisfaction! I am well! I am sound because the Lord has graced my life with His glory, with His presence, and with Himself. Hallelujah! Wherever I am, God is, because I am the carrier of His divine presence and glory! That glory is evident in my physical body, my family, job, business, and in all areas of my life. Blessed be God. Hallelujah!",

        "One of the synonyms for the Greek word translated “edify” is to “charge,” like a battery. Jude 1:20 (AMPC) says, “But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.” He’s telling you to get charged up in the Holy Ghost; embolden yourself in the Holy Ghost through speaking in tongues.",
        "This is what you do when there’re matters arising: you charge yourself up in the Holy Ghost! Are there projects you want to undertake and you’re somewhat not sure what steps to take? Get charged up in the Holy Ghost! Activate the wisdom and power of God by praying in the Holy Ghost until you’re filled with the Spirit.",
        "Ephesians 5:18 says, “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.” This is the secret to a day-to-day life of the miraculous and supernatural: being filled with the Spirit. If someone was timid, and began the exercise of speaking in tongues consistently, soon enough, he’d become bold and sound.",
        "When you speak in other tongues, and your spirit is charged, it takes over your mind; your spirit will rise like a giant from within and dominate the outward man. Paul said to Timothy, “…stir up the gift of God that is in you…” (2 Timothy 1:6). One of the ways to do this is through speaking in tongues.",
        "The reason some Christians faint in the day of adversity is because their inner man is weak, and the reason for that weakness is that they don’t speak in tongues sufficiently. Speaking in tongues imparts courage to your spirit. It produces in you a sense of absolute dominion over adversities.",
        "Refuse to live an ordinary life. There’s power in you; stir it up always. In your privacy, speak in tongues. When you’re on the go, speak in tongues. Keep yourself supercharged all the time. This isn’t for a particular Christian denomination; it’s for every child of God. Get yourself charged up in the Holy Ghost always.",

The Word of God is my life, and it’s exalted in my heart, above every thought, desire, aspiration or belief today! My success in life is guaranteed and unstoppable because I have made the Word of God my contemplation and meditation. I am not moved by the physical circumstances, but I stand firmly on God’s Word, taking advantage of the faith that has been imparted to my spirit to ward off the fiery missiles of the adversary. I reign in life with the Word of God in my spirit and in my mouth. Even as I speak now, the power of God is released to cause the desired change as I put my faith to work. Glory to God.

        "I affirm that I’m living in the centre of God’s will for my life! I’ve been chosen and ordained by God to be productive in all aspects of my life! I walk by faith, and not by sensory perception. I live from the inside out. The circumstances of life are bowing before me because I’m functioning on God’s terms; I reason with the mind of Christ. My outlook on life is from the perspective of the Word who gives me wisdom and the mind-set of the righteous. I’m more than a conqueror, because the greater One lives in me. I’m a champion and a victor forever! There’s now no condemnation for me because I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. My spirit, soul, and body are under the dominion of the Word, and the influence of the Spirit. God’s righteousness is unveiled through me; I manifest the Christ-life, reigning and ruling over circumstances and all the fiery darts of the wicked. Halleluiah!",
        "I affirm that the word of God is enabling me even now, causing a change to take place in my life even at this point. God’s word has given me purpose for life, it has given me vision and my life is meaningful! My mind is renewed with the word of God and I see me positioned for greatness in the realm of the spirit. Daily, God is guiding and stirring me up with his word. My future is blessed, secured and sure! The hands of God is on me: there’s no man nor forces that is powerful enough to stop my dreams from becoming a reality. God had positioned the right people at the right place, the right materials in my path to help me fulfil my assignment here on earth. I’m living a fulfilled life and I will finish my course here on earth with great joy. Never will I leave this world by sickness or by accident; dead can never force me out of this world. I will live to fulfill the number of my days. Every hindering force in my path is moved in the name of Jesus. Glory to God.",
